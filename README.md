# World Weather Analysis
This README is incomplete and will be finished at a later date. 

## Images from weather analysis
The goals of this project were to generate 2000 latitudes and longitudes, use an API to find the weather report for those coordinates, set preferred maximum and minimum vacation temperatures, and then to connect the city coordinates to find hotels in the area. Four hotels are then chosen and an itinerary path is drawn using gmaps. Images of the original hotels from the coordinates, a path linking the four chosen hotels, and the weather report boxes for those four hotels.
